			As soon as you sign up, your name will show up in the lists on the 'Gaze' and 'Record' pages. Just click on it to record a workout, or see your last workout!
			Email: <input type='text' name='email'>
			Of course, everybody else will be able to see your last workout too --- as long as it was less than three days ago. If it's been more, there will be a button that lets them send you an email asking what's gone wrong!
